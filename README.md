# Landmark-Detection-Tracking

## Landmark Detection and Tracking, Robot Moving and Sensing

In this (udacity) project, we are localizing a robot in a 2D grid world. The basis for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is to gather information from a robot's sensors and motions over time, and then use information about measurements and motion to re-construct a map of the world.
